I am a tenure-track assistant professor at the EECS department, Cleveland State University. Prior to joining CSU, I was a postdoc at the Robotics Institute of Carnegie Mellon University. My advisor was [Prof. John M. Dolan](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/john-m-dolan/). I received my Ph.D. degree from Delft University of Technology, the Netherlands under the supervision of [Prof. Sicco Verwer](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/s.e.verwer/) and [Prof. Jan van den Berg](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/j.vandenberg/?cHash=7543638730817b68440527caf616bf8e). My research interests are in the intersection of machine learning, control theory, and formal verification towards the goal to enhance security and safety of safety-critical cyber-physical systems whilst deployed in dynamic, uncertain, and adversarial environments. I develop explainable and verifiable machine learning-based intrusion detection algorithms to protect industrial control systems from cyber attacks. I also rigorously verify safety properties of learning-enabled components and develop safety-guaranteed planning and control algorithms for autonomous driving systems.


<!--<b style="font-size:10;color:purple">I am looking for BS/MS/Ph.D. students to join my lab as founding members. The students are expected to have backgrounds in math/CS/control (preferred: research experience in motion planning or control). Possible topics include: 1) learning-based motion planning and control; 2) safety-assured motion planning and control; 3) security of cyber-physical systems. Due to limited supervision capacity, I am not taking remote interns. If you are interested, please send me your CV, transcripts, and GRE/TOEFL test report.</b> -->

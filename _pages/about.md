I am a tenure-track assistant professor at the EECS department, Cleveland State University. Prior to joining CSU, I was a postdoc at the Robotics Institute of Carnegie Mellon University. My advisor was [Prof. John M. Dolan](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/john-m-dolan/). I crecived my Ph.D. from Delft University of Technology, the Netherlands under the supervision of [Prof. Sicco Verwer](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/s.e.verwer/). My research interests are in the intersection of machine learning, control theory, and formal verification towards the goal to enhance security and safety of safety-critical cyber-physical systems whilst deployed in dynamic, uncertain, and adversarial environments. I develop explainable and verifiable machine learning-based intrusion detection algorithms to protect industrial control systems from cyber attacks. I also rigorously verify safety properties of learning-enabled components and develop safety-guaranteed planning and control algorithms for autonomous driving systems.

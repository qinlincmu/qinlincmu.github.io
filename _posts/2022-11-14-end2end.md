In the work we just submitted, we propose a decoupled approach where an optimal end-to-end controller and a state prediction end-to-end model are learned together, and the predicted state of the vehicle is used to formulate a control barrier function for safeguarding the vehicle to stay within lane boundaries. We validate our algorithm both on a high-fidelity Carla driving simulator and a 1/10-scale RC car on a real track. The evaluation results suggest that using an explicit safety controller helps to learn the task safely with fewer iterations and makes it possible to safely navigate the vehicle on the track along the more challenging racing line. We will provide more information after the paper acceptance.

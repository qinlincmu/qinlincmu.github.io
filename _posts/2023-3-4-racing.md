Autonomous racing is a challenging problem, as the vehicle needs to operate at the friction or handling limits in order to achieve minimum lap times. We propose a unified framework which learns the tire model online from the collected data, as well as adjusts the model based on environmental changes even if the model parameters change by a higher margin. We demonstrate our approach in numeric and high-fidelity simulators for a 1:43 scale race car and a full-size car.

However, most of the existing viewpoint planning methods often rely on discrete space, potentially resulting in missing details when directly employed on the complex surface structure of the blade. Additionally, conventional methods face challenges in controlling the overlap rate of the point cloud due to the thin-walled structure of the blade, which leads to a decrease in the accuracy of the point cloud alignment. This paper introduces a reinforcement learning framework for the viewpoint planning of profiled blades, utilizing the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm to address optimal viewpoints in a continuous space. Effective control over the point cloud overlap rate is achieved through the design of a reward function. Furthermore, constraints related to the robot measurement equipment are formulated, enabling the application of obtained viewpoints on any conventional robot equipment. Through experimental testing, our method demonstrates a substantial improvement in point cloud overlap rate control accuracy, surpassing existing methods by an order of magnitude. Our approach achieves higher coverage using fewer viewpoints in comparison to other reinforcement learning-based viewpoint planning methods. Furthermore, it exhibits generalization capabilities and can assess models that have not been previously encountered.</p> </span> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div id="chen2024uav" class="col three"> <div style="clear: both;"> <div style=""> <img class="col bibone first" src="https://qinlincmu.github.io/assets/img/teasers/walle.jpeg"> </div> </div> <div class="col bibtwo last"> <span class="title">Quadrotor Fault-Tolerant Control at High Speed: A Model-Based Extended State Observer for Mismatched Disturbance Rejection Approach</span> <span class="author"> Jinfeng Chen*, Fan Zhang, Bin Hu, Qiu Fang, and Qin Lin </span> <span class="periodical"> <em>under review</em> 2024 </span> <span class="links"> </span> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div id="zhang2024plan" class="col three"> <div style="clear: both;"> <div style=""> <img class="col bibone first" src="https://qinlincmu.github.io/assets/img/teasers/walle.jpeg"> </div> </div> <div class="col bibtwo last"> <span class="title">Add-on Safe Disturbance Compensation for High-Performance Control of Robotic Systems with Closed Architecture</span> <span class="author"> Fan Zhang*, Jinfeng Chen, Joseph Ahanda, Hanz Richter, Ge Lv, and Qin Lin </span> <span class="periodical"> <em>under preparation</em> 2024 </span> <span class="links"> </span> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div id="zhang2023leso" class="col three"> <div style="clear: both;"> <div style=""> <img class="col bibone first" src="https://qinlincmu.github.io/assets/img/teasers/zhang2023leso.jpg"> </div> </div> <div class="col bibtwo last"> <span class="title">Disturbance Rejection-Guarded Learning for Vibration Suppression of Two-Inertia Systems</span> <span class="author"> Fan Zhang*, Jinfeng Chen, Yu Hu, Zhiqiang Gao, Ge Lv, and Qin Lin </span> <span class="periodical"> <em>IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)</em> 2024 </span> <span class="links"> [<a class="abstract">abstract</a>] [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10240" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a>] </span> <span class="abstract hidden"> <p>Model uncertainty presents significant challenges in vibration suppression of multi-inertia systems, as these systems often rely on inaccurate nominal mathematical models due to system identification errors or unmodeled dynamics. An observer, such as an extended state observer (ESO), can estimate the discrepancy between the inaccurate nominal model and the true model, thus improving control performance via disturbance rejection. The conventional observer design is memoryless in the sense that once its estimated disturbance is obtained and sent to the controller, the datum is discarded. In this research, we propose a seamless integration of ESO and machine learning. On one hand, the machine learning model attempts to model the disturbance. With the assistance of prior information about the disturbance, the observer is expected to achieve faster convergence in disturbance estimation. On the other hand, machine learning benefits from an additional assurance layer provided by the ESO, as any imperfections in the machine learning model can be compensated for by the ESO. We validated the effectiveness of this novel learning-for-control paradigm through simulation and physical tests on two-inertial motion control systems used for vibration studies.</p> </span> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div id="kalaria2023mad" class="col three"> <div style="clear: both;"> <div style=""> <img class="col bibone first" src="https://qinlincmu.github.io/assets/img/teasers/kalaria2023mad.png"> </div> </div> <div class="col bibtwo last"> <span class="title">Towards Optimal Head-to-head Autonomous Racing with Curriculum Reinforcement Learning</span> <span class="author"> Dvij Kalaria*, Qin Lin, and John M.

Autonomous race cars require highly accurate perception, state estimation, planning and precise application of controls. What makes it even more challenging is the accurate identification of vehicle model parameters that dictate the effects of the lateral tire slip, which may change over time, for example, due to wear and tear of the tires. Current works either propose model identification offline or need good parameters to start with (within 15-20% of actual vacdclue), which is not enough to account for major changes in tire model that occur during actual races when driving at the control limits. We propose a unified framework which learns the tire model online from the collected data, as well as adjusts the model based on environmental changes even if the model parameters change by a higher margin.

First, the holistic simulation model consists of two sub-models as per the actual operation rules of the transfer station. Without knowing the exact distribution form, a time probability density distribution model is established based on kernel density estimation and incorporated into the two sub-models. Second, built on the simulation model, two operation schemes are proposed to improve the operation efficiency.

The protection of ICS that are employed in public critical infrastructures is of utmost importance due to catastrophic physical damages a potential attack may cause. The research community needs testbeds for validation and comparing various intrusion detection algorithms to protect ICS. However, there exist high barriers to entry for research and education in the ICS cybersecurity domain due to expensive hardware, software, and inherent dangers of manipulating real-world systems. To close the gap, built upon recently developed 3D high-fidelity simulators, we further showcase our integrated framework to automatically launch cyberattacks, collect data, train machine learning models, and evaluate for practical chemical and manufacturing processes. We present a novel intrusion detection model called Minimal Threshold and Window SVM (MinTWin SVM) that utilizes unsupervised machine learning via a one-class SVM in combination with a sliding window and classification threshold. The design of MinTWin SVM is driven by the desire to provide continuous and accurate monitoring of the ICS without erroneously identifying the system as under attack as well as to minimize the input to the classifier in the interest of lessening computational overhead. Results show that MinTWin SVM minimizes false positives and is responsive to physical process anomalies. Furthermore, we incorporate our framework with ICS cybersecurity education by using our dataset in an undergraduate machine learning course where students gain hands-on experience in practicing machine learning theory with a practical ICS dataset.

Traditional autonomous pipelines require accurate pre-mapping, localization, and planning which make the task computationally expensive and environment-dependent. Recent works propose use of imitation and reinforcement learning to train end-to-end deep neural networks and have shown promising results for high-speed racing. However, the end-to-end models may be dangerous to be deployed on real systems, as the neural networks are treated as black-box models devoid of any provable safety guarantees. In this work we propose a decoupled approach where an optimal end-to-end controller and a state prediction end-to-end model are learned together, and the predicted state of the vehicle is used to formulate a control barrier function for safeguarding the vehicle to stay within lane boundaries. We validate our algorithm both on a high-fidelity Carla driving simulator and a 1/10-scale RC car on a real track. The evaluation results suggest that using an explicit safety controller helps to learn the task safely with fewer iterations and makes it possible to safely navigate the vehicle on the track along the more challenging racing line.</p> </span> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div id="deolasee2022spatio" class="col three"> <div style="clear: both;"> <div style=""> <img class="col bibone first" src="https://qinlincmu.github.io/assets/img/teasers/deolasee2022spatio.png"> </div> </div> <div class="col bibtwo last"> <span class="title">Spatio-temporal Motion Planning for Autonomous Vehicles with Trapezoidal Prism Corridors and Bezier Curves</span> <span class="author"> Srujan Deolasee*, Qin Lin, Jialun Li, and John M.

Spatial-temporal approaches deal with path planning and speed planning simultaneously; however, the existing methods only support simple-shaped corridors like cuboids, which restrict the search space for optimization in complex scenarios. We propose to use trapezoidal prism-shaped corridors for optimization, which significantly enlarges the solution space compared to the existing cuboidal corridors-based method.

However, the provable safety is established on an accurate dynamic model and access to all states. To address such a vulnerability, this paper proposes a novel design combining an extended state observer (ESO) with a CBF for safe control of a system with model uncertainty and external disturbances only using output measurement. Unlike other disturbance observer-based CBFs, ESO is a more general approach to directly estimate the disturbances in the original system rather than the effect of the disturbance on CBF. As a result, our approach delivers a less conservative estimation error bound. Moreover, only output measurements are needed to estimate the disturbances instead of the full access to states. The bound of state estimation error and disturbance estimation error is derived in a unified manner and then used for robust safe control under uncertainty. We validate our approach?s efficacy in numerical simulations of an adaptive cruise control system and a Segway self-balancing scooter.</p> </span> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div id="kalaria2022delay" class="col three"> <div style="clear: both;"> <div style=""> <img class="col bibone first" src="https://qinlincmu.github.io/assets/img/teasers/kalaria2022delay.png"> </div> </div> <div class="col bibtwo last"> <span class="title">Delay-aware Robust Control for Safe Autonomous Driving and Racing</span> <span class="author"> Dvij Kalaria*, Qin Lin, and John M.

Unfortunately, delays are typically not considered during the conventional controller design or learning-enabled controller training phases prior to deployment in the physical world. In this paper, the computation delay from nonlinear optimization for motion planning and control, as well as other unavoidable delays caused by actuators, are addressed systematically and unifiedly. To deal with all these delays, in our framework: 1) we propose a new filtering approach with no prior knowledge of dynamics and disturbance distribution to adaptively and safely estimate the time-variant computation delay; 2) we model actuation dynamics for steering delay; 3) all the constrained optimization is realized in a robust tube model predictive controller. For the application merits, we demonstrate that our approach is suitable for both autonomous driving and autonomous racing. Our approach is a novel design for a standalone delay compensation controller. In addition, in the case that a learning-enabled controller assuming no delay works as a primary controller, our approach serves as the primary controller’s safety guard.

However, the provable safety relies on a precisely described dynamic model, which is not always available in practice. Recent works leverage learning to compensate model uncertainty for a CBF controller. However, these approaches based on reinforcement learning or episodic learning are limited to dealing with time-invariant uncertainty. Also, the reinforcement learning approach learns the uncertainty offline, while episodic learning only updates the controller after a batch of data is available by the end of an episode. Instead, we propose a novel tuning extreme learning machine (tELM)-based CBF controller that can compensate time-variant and time-invariant model uncertainty adaptively in an online manner.

Other factors such as actuator dynamics and actuator command processing cost also unavoidably cause delays. In high-speed scenarios, these delays are critical to the safety of a vehicle. Recent works consider these delays individually, but none unifies them all in the context of autonomous driving. Moreover, recent works inappropriately consider computation time as a constant or a large upper bound, which makes the control either less responsive or over-conservative. To deal with all these delays, we present a unified framework by 1) modeling actuation dynamics, 2) using robust tube model predictive control, and 3) using a novel adaptive Kalman filter without assuming a known process model and noise covariance, which makes the controller safe while minimizing conservativeness. On the one hand, our approach can serve as a standalone controller; on the other hand, our approach provides a safety guard for a high-level controller, which assumes no delay. This can be used for compensating the sim-to-real gap when deploying a black-box learning-enabled controller trained in a simplistic environment without considering delays for practical vehicle systems.</p> </span> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="year">2021</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div id="lin2021safe" class="col three"> <div style="clear: both;"> <div style=""> <img class="col bibone first" src="https://qinlincmu.github.io/assets/img/teasers/lin2021safe.gif"> </div> </div> <div class="col bibtwo last"> <span class="title">Safe and resilient practical waypoint-following for autonomous vehicles</span> <span class="author"> Qin Lin, Stefan Mitsch, André Platzer, and John M.

However, the previous work considers either deterministic trajectories or persistent prediction for target dynamical obstacles. The other drawback is lack of generality - it requires manual weight tuning for different scenarios. In this paper, two significant improvements are achieved. Firstly, a twostage uncertainty-aware prediction is proposed. The short-term prediction with safety guarantee based on reachability analysis is responsible for dealing with extreme maneuvers conducted by target vehicles. The long-term prediction leveraging an adaptive least square filter preserves the long-term optimality of the planned trajectory since using reachability only for long-term prediction is too pessimistic and makes the planner over-conservative. Secondly, to allow a wider coverage over different scenarios and to avoid tedious parameter tuning case by case, this paper designs a scenario-based analytical function taking the states from the ego vehicle and the target vehicle as input, and carrying weights of a cost function as output. It allows the ego vehicle to execute multiple behaviors (such as lane-keeping and overtaking) under a single planner. We demonstrate safety, effectiveness, and real-time performance of the proposed planner in simulations.</p> </span> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div id="lin2020reachflow" class="col three"> <div style="clear: both;"> <div style=""> <img class="col bibone first" src="https://qinlincmu.github.io/assets/img/teasers/lin2020reachflow.png"> </div> </div> <div class="col bibtwo last"> <span class="title">Reachflow: An online safety assurance framework for waypoint-following of self-driving cars</span> <span class="author"> Qin Lin, Xin Chen, Aman Khurana, and John M.

It mainly consists of two components: (a) an online verification tool which conservatively checks the safety of the system behavior in the near future, and (b) a fallback controller which steers the system back to a desired state when the system is potentially unsafe. We implement ReachFlow in a self-driving racing car governed by a reinforcement learning-based controller.

For safety-critical systems such as autonomous vehicles, it can be problematic to use controllers learned from data because they cannot be guaranteed to be collision-free. Recently, a method has been proposed for learning a multi-mode hybrid automaton cruise controller (MOHA). Besides being accurate, the logical nature of this model makes it suitable for formal verification. In this paper, we demonstrate this capability using the SpaceEx hybrid model checker as follows. We develop an automated tool to translate the automaton model into constraints and equations required by SpaceEx. We then verify that a pure MOHA controller is not collision-free. By adding a safety state based on headway in time, a rule that human drivers should follow anyway, we do obtain a provably safe cruise control.

Process anomaly detection mechanisms have been proposed to protect such systems to minimize the risk of damage or loss of resources.

Timed automata are learned as a model of regular behaviors shown in sensors signal like fluctuations of water level in tanks. Bayesian networks are learned to discover dependencies between sensors and actuators. The models are used as a one-class classifier for process anomaly detection, recognizing irregular behavioral patterns and dependencies. The detection results can be interpreted and the abnormal sensors or actuators localized due to the interpretability of the graphical models. This approach is applied to a dataset collected from SWaT. Experimental results demonstrate the model’s superior performance on both precision and run-time over methods including support vector machine and deep neural networks.

We show two small case studies where the alphabets are respectively the natural and real numbers, and show how nice properties of automata models like interpretability and graphical representation transfer to regression where typical models are hard to interpret.</p> </span> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="year">2016</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div id="Hammerschmidt2016" class="col three"> <div style="clear: both;"> <div style=""> <img class="col bibone first" src="https://qinlincmu.github.io/assets/img/teasers/lin2016RA.jpg"> </div> </div> <div class="col bibtwo last"> <span class="title">Interpreting Finite Automata for Sequential Data</span> <span class="author"> Christian Hammerschmidt, Verwer, and Qin Lin </span> <span class="periodical"> <em>NIPS workshop proceedings</em> 2016 </span> <span class="links"> [<a class="abstract">abstract</a>] [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07100" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a>] </span> <span class="abstract hidden"> <p>Automaton models are often seen as interpretable models. Interpretability itself is not well defined: it remains unclear what interpretability means without first explicitly specifying objectives or desired attributes. In this paper, we identify the key properties used to interpret automata and propose a modification of a state-merging approach to learn variants of finite state automata. We apply the approach to problems beyond typical grammar inference tasks. Additionally, we cover several use-cases for prediction, classification, and clustering on sequential data in both supervised and unsupervised scenarios to show how the identified key properties are applicable in a wide range of contexts.</p> </span> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div id="lin2016RA" class="col three"> <div style="clear: both;"> <div style=""> <img class="col bibone first" src="https://qinlincmu.github.io/assets/img/teasers/lin2016RA.jpg"> </div> </div> <div class="col bibtwo last"> <span class="title">Short-term Time Series Forecasting with Regression Automata</span> <span class="author"> Qin Lin, Christian Hammerschmidt, Gaetano Pellegrino, and Sicco Verwer </span> <span class="periodical"> <em>Interpretable Machine Learning for Complex Systems: NIPS workshop proceedings</em> 2016 </span> <span class="links"> [<a class="abstract">abstract</a>] [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tc-JVDsJf2c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a>] [<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306039837_Short-term_Time_Series_Forecasting_with_Regression_Automata" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a>] </span> <span class="abstract hidden"> <p>We present regression automata (RA), which are novel type syntactic models for time series forecasting. Building on top of conventional state-merging algorithms for identifying automata, RA use numeric data in addition to symbolic values and make predictions based on this data in a regression fashion. We apply our model to the problem of hourly wind speed and wind power forecasting. Our results show that RA outperform other state-of-the-art approaches for predicting both wind speed and power generation. In both cases, short-term predictions are used for resource allocation and infrastructure load balancing. For those critical tasks, the ability to inspect and interpret the generative model RA provide is an additional benefit.</p> </span> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="year">2014</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div id="gu2014automatic" class="col three"> <div style="clear: both;"> <div style=""> <img class="col bibone first" src="https://qinlincmu.github.io/assets/img/teasers/gu2014automatic.jpg"> </div> </div> <div class="col bibtwo last"> <span class="title">Automatic contour-based road network design for optimized wind farm micrositing</span> <span class="author"> Huajie Gu, Jun Wang, Qin Lin, and Qi Gong </span> <span class="periodical"> <em>IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy</em> 2014 </span> <span class="links"> [<a class="abstract">abstract</a>] [<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6979252" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a>] </span> <span class="abstract hidden"> <p>Constructing the access roads between wind turbines requires a significant cost when a wind farm is built in hills or mountains. An optimized design of road network can substantially reduce construction costs and increase investment returns. In this paper, we consider a challenging problem of the road network design for a wind farm with complex topography. An automatic contour-based model is developed for road network design, and is incorporated into the optimization of wind farm micrositing to maximize investment returns of the wind farm. The directions of access roads are first deduced from a contour tree, the route projections are then designed by a gradient-bounded algorithm, and the most cost-effective road network is finally obtained by the minimum spanning tree algorithm. The topographic speedup, wind resource grid and Park wake model are incorporated to accurately evaluate the power production of the wind farm. Both the profit of wind energy sales and the cost of access roads are combined into a cost function called net present value, which is optimized using genetic algorithms. Simulation results illustrate that the length of access roads is decreased significantly while the locations of wind turbines are optimized. The proposed method simultaneously optimizes the turbine layout and road network of the wind farm, therefore achieving a more practical and profitable wind farm micrositing.</p> </span> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div id="lin2014vertically" class="col three"> <div style="clear: both;"> <div style=""> <img class="col bibone first" src="https://qinlincmu.github.io/assets/img/teasers/lin2014vertically.jpg"> </div> </div> <div class="col bibtwo last"> <span class="title">Vertically correlated echelon model for the interpolation of missing wind speed data</span> <span class="author"> Qin Lin, and Jun Wang </span> <span class="periodical"> <em>IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy</em> 2014 </span> <span class="links"> [<a class="abstract">abstract</a>] [<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6775308" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a>] </span> <span class="abstract hidden"> <p>The wind speeds of a wind farm are not always available or accurately measurable due to uncontrollable events such as anemometer failures or data transmission errors. However, the data are of great importance for wind resource assessment and wind speed prediction. In this paper, a vertically correlated echelon model (CEM) is proposed to interpolate the missing data of wind speeds by utilizing the correlation of wind speeds at different heights. First, the data of wind speed are checked according to a national standard. Second, the model based on the correlation of wind speeds at different heights is proposed for short interval of missing data. Third, the proposed method is compared with typical interpolation methods and its advantages and disadvantages are discussed. Finally, the uncertainty of the proposed method is analyzed for improved evaluation of interpolation errors.</p> </span> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="year">2013</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div id="lin2013denoising" class="col three"> <div style="clear: both;"> <div style=""> <img class="col bibone first" src="https://qinlincmu.github.io/assets/img/teasers/lin2013denoising.jpg"> </div> </div> <div class="col bibtwo last"> <span class="title">Denoising of wind speed data by wavelet thresholding</span> <span class="author"> Qin Lin, Jun Wang, and Weiting Qiao </span> <span class="periodical"> <em>Chinese Automation Congress</em> 2013 </span> <span class="links"> [<a class="abstract">abstract</a>] [<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6775789" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a>] </span> <span class="abstract hidden"> <p>Completeness and reasonableness test of wind farm data is a critical prerequisite for wind speed prediction, meanwhile it plays an important role on the reliability and safety of the grids. The key to dealing with the unreasonable data lies in eliminating the noise. In this work, we perform an analysis of the noise source of wind speed data observed in wind farm and highlight using the wavelet analysis to eliminate the noise. To test the denoising effect, the equivalent wind speed model is then established. Experiment results show that the effective preprocessing of the raw data yield good performance for attenuating the influence of noises.</p> </span> </div> </div> </li></ol> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Qin Lin, 林勤.
